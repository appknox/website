  dastAnalysis: A Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) analysis is generally specifically designed to detect conditions indicative of a security vulnerability in an application while in its running state. One of the most common and classic methods of hacking used by hackers is the Man in the Middle Attack (MiTM).
  fullyAutomatedSimulation: The Appknox DAST is a fully automated simulation of real-time interactions between users (your team) and our physical Android and iOS devices accessed by you via our cloud-based infrastructure. Our system analyzes, detects and catches loopholes that are threatening in nature and helps businesses plug and secure them from runtime and network attacks like MiTM.
  differenceBetween: Difference between SAST &amp; DAST
  unlikeSASTAnalysis: Unlike the SAST analysis, Appknox DAST works by running your uploaded application binary on our cloud-hosted devices. Your app is simply uploaded and put in a test environment where actual attacks are carried out during this simulation to detect advanced vulnerabilities.
