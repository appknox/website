  explosiveGrowth: The explosive growth of mobile apps has created an industry of app development where time-to-market is everything. Security has suffered often, and very publicly, insecure apps have leaked payment, banking, and other sensitive user data much to the embarrassment of major brands.
  securitySpace: We’ve been in the security space for over five years now. But the mission to build a safe and secure mobile ecosystem began in January 2014 when many public disclosures came to light - Starbucks, Snapchat, and more. Private and confidential data of millions of people were revealed publicly.
