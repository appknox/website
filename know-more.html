            </div>
            <div class="ast-answer">
              Appknox’s architecture is built using multiple ‘task-workers’. Each worker runs on a dierent machine to scan applications
              in parallel to one another. This means that as a business you can perform multiple scans simultaneously without any
              interruption on the Appknox dashboard.
