            <div class="ast-answer">
              Static Application Security Testing (SAST) can be considered as testing an application from the inside out by
              examination its source code or application binaries for issues based on configuration which point towards a security vulnerability.

              Tests cover industry security compliances like OWASP Top 10, PCI-DSS, HIPAA and other commonly
              exploited basic security threat parameters.Your report is then generated with threat details listed
               with zero false positives according to high, medium and low severity.

              <p>Appknox's architecture is built using multiple &#39;tast-workers&#39;. Each worker runs on a different machine to scan
              application in parallel to one another. This means that as a business you can perform multiple scans simultaneously

              What is DAST
            </div>
            <div class="ast-answer">
              A Dynamic application security testing (DAST) analysis is generally specifically designed to detect conditions indicative of a security vulnerability in an application while in its running state.
              One of the most common and classic methods of hacking used by hackers is the Man in the middle attack (MITM).
            </div>
            <div class="ast-answer">
              The Appknox DAST is a fully automated simulation of real time interactions between users (your team) and our physical Android and iOS devices accessed by you via our cloud-based infrastructure.
              Our system analyzes, detects and catches loopholes that are threatening in nature and helps businesses plug and secure them from runtime attacks, like MITM.

              Difference between SAST &amp; DAST
            </div>
            <div class="ast-answer">
              Unlike the SAST Analysis, Appknox DAST works by running your uploaded application binary on our cloud-hosted devices.
              Your app is simply uploaded and put in a test environment where actual attacks are carried out during this simulation to detect advanced vulnerabilities.
            </div>
            <div class="ast-answer">
              The Appknox DAST runs on the same platform as the Appknox SAST, giving businesses the option to scan their apps individually or together by both analysis, for an integrated view of all threats detected.
